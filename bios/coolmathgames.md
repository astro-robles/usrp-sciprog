Cole Meyer is a rising junior in the Astrophysical Sciences Department at Princeton University hoping to earn a certificate in Applied and Computational Mathematics. While he is hoping to explore instrumentation within astrophysics over Summer 2022 and throughout his final two years at Princeton, he is largely undecided about which field he would like to specialize in post-Princeton. Outside of class, he will be an RCA for Yeh College in the Fall, is the President of the Princeton Astronomy Club, and an avid coffee connoisseur.
